Computer Graphics Assignment #2

This is a program to visualize different objects using the light ray simulation and shade plotting.

-	Selecting between “Sphere” and “Polygon”:

Inside the “MainClass” comment/uncomment value of “object” in line 18 of the code for selecting “Sphere” or “Polygon” Geometry.

-	Modifying Values of Sphere/Polygon:

The sphere/polygon objects can be found on line 36/37 of the code.

Value for sphere are (float x, float y, float z, float radius, float Kd)

Value for polygon are (Vector v1, Vector v2, Vector v3, Vector v4, float Kd)

-	See the result:

The result will be generated as a jpeg image.

The result will be located inside the “CG_Assignment2” directory.
